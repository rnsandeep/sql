1. Difference between Truncate and Delete?
   Delete will delete rows and it will allow roll back where as Truncate can delete rows and cols and cannot roll back.
   Truncate is part of DDL (Data Descriptive Language)
   Delete is part of DML( Data Manipulative Language)
   
2. Subsets of SQL?
   1. DML : Data Manipulative Language.
   2. DDL : Data Descriptive Language.
   3. DCL : Data Control Language.
   4. TCL : Transaction Control Language.

3. Different Types of DBMS:
   1. Heirarchical: Predecussor and Successor.
   2. Relational
   3. Network
   4. Object Oriented
   
4. Table and Field
   Table has column names called Fields.
   
5. Join in sql.
    Combine two tables based on common elements. 
    Inner Join, OUter Join.
    
6. Char and varchar2:
   Char: Fixed length
   Varchar2: Variable Length.
   
7. Primary Key:
   Uniquely Identify a Table.
   
8. What are constraints:
    Used to limit the data Type of table.
    Not Null: Null value cannot be stored.
    Unique: All values are different.
    Check : Ensures specific condition.
    Index : Create and retrieve database very quickly.
    
9. SQL and MySQL.
   SQL : language.
   MYSQL: DBMS. 
   
10. Unique key:
    Identify single row in table.
    Duplicate values are not allowed.
    
11. Foreign Key:
    References Primary key in the parent table.

12. What do you mean by data integrity.
    Accuracy and consistency.
    
13. What is difference b/w clustered and non-clustered Index.
    Cluster able to retrieve data are faster than non clustered Index.
    One table has only one clustered Index and any non-clustere Index.
    
14. Write a sql query to display current day.
    SELECT GETDATE();
 
15. What are different type of joins.
    1. Inner Join: Matching values in both Tables.
    2. Full Join: Return all values from both tables.
    3. Left Join: Return all left and matching from right.
    4. Right Join: Return all right and matching from left.

16. What do you mean by denormalization.
    Access data from higher to lower forms of a table.
    Adds redundant data from different tables.
 
17. Entities and Relationships.
    Entities are real world objects.
    Relationships are relationship b/w entities which are usually represented in a table.

18. Index: Performance tuning to get faster retrieval of data from table.
           Creates entry for each value. 

19. Unique Index, Clustere, non-clustered.
    Unique: no duplicate values.
    clustered: reorder physical order of table. Only one clustered Index.
    non-clustured: any number of non-clsutred.
    
20. Normalization: Avoid duplication and redundancy. more tables with smaller rows. easier security . MOre compact and consistent.

21. Drop and Truncate: Drop removes table and cannot be rolled back.
     Truncate removes all rows from table and can be rolled back.

22. Normalization Types:
    1. 1NF : each table cell should have only one value. All records must be unique.
    2. 2NF : Divide table into two tables. table should have single column primary key and should be 1NF.
    3. 3NF : must be 2NF. Not have any transitive functional dependency.
    4. BCNF: must be 3NF. must have only one candidate key present in table.
    
23. ACID properties.
     Atomicity: Transactions completed Either completely done or failed.
     Consistency: Must meet validation rules. 
     Isolation: concurrency control.
     Durability: Transaction to be done no matter what.
 
24. Trigger:
     Execute something when an insertor update  or delete happens. 

25. Types of Operators in SQL:
    Arithmetic, Bitwise, Logical, Compound, Comparison.
   
26. NULL is zero or blank space? :
    No, NULL is unavailable and not applicable. 
    
27. Cross Join: Produces the cross product.
    Natural Join: having same name and data type.
    
28. Sub query : Always executed first and passed to main query.
     Any errors in sub query will be full error.
 
29. Correlated sub query and Non correlated sub query.
  
30. Count no of records in table.
    SELECT * from TABLE1;
    SELECT COUNT(*) from TABLE2;
 
31. Write a query to display employee name which start with A.
    SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE EMPLOYEE_NAME like 'A%'
 
32. SQL query of third highest salary of employee .
    SELECT TOP 1 salary (SELECT TOP 3 salary FROM EMPLOYEE_TABLE ORDER BY SALARY DESC) as emp ORDER BY ASC;
    
33. GROUP functions.
    AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, VARIANCE.
    
34. Relationship and different types of relationships.
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one.
    
35. INSERT NULL VALUES while inserting data.
    EXPLLICIT put NULL Values.
    or vomit col value from col list.
 
36. BETWEEN and IN:
    BETWEEN check between values.
    IN check if they are in values.
    
37. SQL to modify, insert, calculate .

38. MERGE: conditional update or insertion into a table.

39. Recursive stored procedure: similar to recursion until boundary coundtion.

40. SQL CLAUSE: HAVING OR WHERE:
     restricts data by  having condition.
     
41. HAVING and WHERE:
 
42: DYNAMIC SQL: 

43: CONSTRAINTS: column level and tabel level.

44. INTERSECT: 
    QUERY1 INTERSECT QUERY2
    
45. STRING CASE manipulation:
    LOWER, UPPER, INITCAP.

46. OPERATORS DIFFERENT SET,
    UNION : combine 
    INTERSECT: intersection.
    MINUS: 

47. ALIAS command:
    identify a particular table or column
    
48. AGGREGATE: MAX, COUNT
    SCALAR : UCASE(), NOW()
    
49. PATTERN MATCHING:
    like ex: like 'A%' .. students with starting name A.

50. UNIQUE RECORDS:
     DISTINCT key word.
     
51. fetch five characters or string:
     SUBSTRING(), RIGHT()
     
52. SQL and PL/SQL.
    PL/SQL : loops and procedures.
    
53. VIEW:
    Virtual table.
    Restricting data.

54. STORED procedure. several sql combined 
    
55. ADV/ DISADV of stored procedures.
    MODULAR - ADV.
    FASTER, SECURITY.
    DISADV: only in DATABASE AND MORE MEMORY.
    
 56. USER defined functions: 
     SCALAR
 
 57 LOCAL and GLOBAL VARIABLES:
 
 58. AUTO INCREMENT SQL; increment whenever new record.
 
 59. DATA WAREHOUSE: MULTIPLE SOURCES of info.
 
 60. AUTHENTIC MODES: WINDOWS, MIXED.
 
 61. STUFF and REPLACE;
