1. DEFAULT constraint:
create table student(sid int, sname varchar(20), smarks int default 50)

insert into student(sid, sname) values(1, 'sam')
insert into student(sid, sname) values(2, 'mat')

select * from student 
Output: 1 sam 50

2. UNIQUE constraint:
create table student(sid int unique, sname varchar(20))
cannot insert duplicate values for sid. 

3. FInd the second highest salary from the table.

select max(e_salary) from employee where e_salary not in (select max(e_salary) from employee)

4. Normalization and Denormalization

Normalization : reduce redundancy and inconsistency. Organizing Fields in database.
Denormalization: Create redundancy to increase speed of query by grouping. 

5. select e_gender, avg(e_age) from employee where avg(e_age) > 30 group by gender ; instead we should use
   select e_gender, avg(e_age) from employee group by e_gender having avg(e_age) > 30; 

6. STUFF( string1, position, length, string2)
   SANDEEP, 2, 6, IRISHA  -> SIRISHA
   
7. VIEW in sql. virtual tables 
   create view female_employee as select * from employee where e_gender='female'
   create view age as select * from employee where e_age > 25

8. stored procedure is a prepared sql code which can be saved and reused.
   create procedure employee_age 
   as
   select e_age from employee 
   go
   
   exec employee_age
   
9. JOINS: INNER, OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT.
   INNER: matching in both. 
   select columns from table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column1=table2.column2
   select employee.e_name, employee.e_dept, department.d_name, department.d_location 
   from employee 
   inner join department on 
   employee.e_dept=department.d_name
   
10. Temporary table. after session it will be terminated.
    create table #book(b_id int, b_cost int)
    insert into #book(1, 100)
    select * from #book
    
11. OLTP, OLAP. 
    ONLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING
    ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING ( low frequency and too complex involving aggregation- data mining).
    
12. DELETE and TRUNCATE:
    DELETE one or more existing tables.
    delete from student where sid=3 - DML command.
    truncate table student - DDL command 
    if table has foreign key we can't truncate.
    
13. UNION and UNION_ALL operator.
    A U B.
 
14. select * from student_details1 
    union
    select * from student_details2

15. copy data from one table into another table.
    create table employee_duplicate(
    eid int,
    ename varchar(20),
    esalary int,
    eage int,
    egender varchar(20)
    )
    select * from employee_duplicate
    insert into employee_duplicate select * from employee
    -> copied from employee into employee_duplicate.
